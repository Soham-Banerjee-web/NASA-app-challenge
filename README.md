# NASA-app-challenge
🚀 Overview

This project was built for the NASA International Space Apps Challenge, where our goal was to design a scalable, cloud-based solution that uses machine learning and geospatial data to tackle real-world space & Earth-based challenges.

Our application integrates:

Neural-network based data processing (Python, TensorFlow)

Geospatial image analysis (satellite / remote-sensing data)

Cloud deployment for real-time processing & accessibility

A user-friendly interface for data visualisation and decision-making

🧑‍💻 Key Features

End-to-end ML pipeline: data ingestion → preprocessing → model inference → results

Satellite imagery / remote‐sensing analysis (e.g., shape‐from‐shading, DEM generation)

Web-based user interface to visualise results and interact with predictions

Modular architecture to allow expansion into other aerospace or Earth-science use-cases

🔧 Tech Stack

Languages & Frameworks: Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript

ML / Data Science: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV

Cloud & Deployment: AWS (S3, Lambda, EC2, SageMaker) or equivalent cloud stack

Other Tools: Docker, GitHub Actions (CI/CD), REST APIs
